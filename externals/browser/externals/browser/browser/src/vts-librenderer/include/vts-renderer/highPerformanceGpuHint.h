Defining these symbols gives a hint to the system that,
when creating OpenGL context, it should choose high performance gpu,
if multiple gpus were available.
This is specifically useful for laptops with switchable gpus.

These symbols have to be defined in the actual application,
not in a library,
therefore we provide it in the form of an include header.
Make sure that the header is included in exactly one translation unit
(one c or cpp file), preferably the main file.
